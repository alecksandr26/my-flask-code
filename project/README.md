# Simple Todo list
Its a simple project where I used all the learned things from flask, jinja2 and sqlalchemy.
## Create the virtual env and build
When you create the virtualenv you will need to install the requirements, so just run.
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## DataBase for the aplication 
I'm using gcloud with a simple firebase to manipulate and save the data from the users and todos, then you can install and configure the `google sdk` easily here on this link. <br />
gcloud: [google sdk](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install-sdk) <br />
Here is a simple page to see how it works [firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore?hl=es-419) <br />
And at the end you will need to create a service to be able to access creating this service you will get a `key.json` to be able to connect successful.<br />

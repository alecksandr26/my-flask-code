# To run
It is easy you can create a shell variable called `FLASK_APP` and yout put the name of the file.

`export FLASK_APP=main.py`

After that with the flask command we can run the app.

`flask run`

## Debugging with flask
To debug with flask, we need to create another shell variable called  `FLASK_DEBUG` and you need to set this variable with "1".

`export FLASK_DEBUG=1`
